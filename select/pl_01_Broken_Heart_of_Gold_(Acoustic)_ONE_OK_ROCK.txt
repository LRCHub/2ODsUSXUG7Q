I move along
Somethings wrong
I guess a part of me is gone
Skies are gray
Start to fade
I guess I threw it all away
Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life I'm done with it
When it feels too painfull
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painfull
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
Tired soul
Dying hope
I guess I’m running out of road
I guess I’ve got nowhere
Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life I'm done with it
When it feels too painfull
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painfull
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
もう消えそうで
弱り切った声で
また振り払って
でも feels like I’m in hell
I’m in hell
Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life I'm done with it
When it feels too painfull
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painfull
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
